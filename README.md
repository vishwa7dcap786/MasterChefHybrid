MasterChefHybrid

    MasterChefHybrid is a smart contract that combines the functionalities of both MasterChef V1 and V2 into a single contract. This contract manages staking pools, rewards distribution, and liquidity mining, while also having the minting rights for the SUSHI token. It's designed to behave like MasterChef V2 but with added flexibility from V1, and introduces new features like support for rewarder contracts and LP token migration.

Features

    * SUSHI Minting Rights: The contract has sole authority to mint new SUSHI tokens.
    * Staking Pools: Users can stake liquidity provider (LP) tokens to earn SUSHI rewards.
    * Pool Management: Owners can add new pools, update existing ones, and manage LP tokens.
    * Reward Allocation: Automatically allocates SUSHI tokens as rewards based on staked amounts.
    * Bonus Multiplier: Early SUSHI stakers can benefit from a bonus reward multiplier.
    * Rewarder Contract Support: Integrates with rewarder contracts for customizable reward distribution.
    * LP Token Migration: Provides an easy mechanism to migrate LP tokens through the IMigratorChef interface.
